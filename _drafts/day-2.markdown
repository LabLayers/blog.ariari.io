##Music
Today's song comes from the [electro-swing playlist][playlist] I was listening to on the subway ride from Brooklyn to Manhattan. If you're not into electro-swing yet, you're about to be. Definitely my favourite genre of all time. This particular mix is just - yum. It samples a couple tracks that I remember from the Monopoly PC game back in the early 2000s, which was basically my first taste of New York, so it feels particularly vintage New York-y to me. (Side note: the street/metro names are monopoly spaces. LOL. I guess they had to come from somewhere.)

[Swing Mood (Castaman Edit Mix)][song]

Anyone know of any cool electroswing clubs in NYC? I know it's big in Montreal - some of my best nights out have been swinging.

##Reading
This [poem][poem] was sent to me by Collin this morning. I'll include the whole text, because I think it's beautiful:

_All through that Sunday afternoon_    
_a kite flew above Sunday,_    
_a tightened drumhead, an armful of blown chaff._    

_I’d seen it grey and slippy in the making,_    
_I’d tapped it when it dried out white and stiff,_    
_I’d tied the bows of newspaper_   
_along its six-foot tail._   
  
_But now it was far up like a small black lark_   
_and now it dragged as if the bellied string_   
_were a wet rope hauled upon_   
_to lift a shoal._    

_My friend says that the human soul_   
_is about the weight of a snipe,_   
_yet the soul at anchor there,_    
_the string that sags and ascends,_   
_weigh like a furrow assumed into the heavens._   

_Before the kite plunges down into the wood_   
_and this line goes useless_    
_take in your two hands, boys, and feel_   
_the strumming, rooted, long-tailed pull of grief._   
_You were born fit for it._    
_Stand in here in front of me_    
_and take the strain._   

Kites, as a representation of life. I don't think I can remember the last time I flew one, myself. I'll have to make a point of doing that soon.
