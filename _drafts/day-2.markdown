##Music
Today's song comes from the [electro-swing playlist][playlist] I was listening to on the subway ride from Brooklyn to Manhattan. If you're not into electro-swing yet, you're about to be. Definitely my favourite genre of all time. This particular mix is just - yum. It samples a couple tracks that I remember from the Monopoly PC game back in the early 2000s, which was basically my first taste of New York, so it feels particularly vintage New York-y to me. (Side note: the street/metro names are monopoly spaces. LOL. I guess they had to come from somewhere.)

[Swing Mood (Castaman Edit Mix)][song]

Anyone know of any cool electroswing clubs in NYC? I know it's big in Montreal - some of my best nights out have been swinging.
