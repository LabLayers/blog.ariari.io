<p>Today’s song comes from the <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/2R6xBIkSYaiyf4XjwpvUb5">electro-swing playlist</a> I was listening to on the subway ride from Brooklyn to Manhattan. If you’re not into electro-swing yet, you’re about to be. Definitely my favourite genre of all time. This particular mix is just - yum. It samples a couple tracks that I remember from the Monopoly PC game back in the early 2000s, which was basically my first taste of New York, so it feels particularly vintage New York-y to me. (Side note: the street/metro names are monopoly spaces. LOL. I guess they had to come from somewhere.)</p>

<p>Anyone know of any cool electroswing clubs in NYC? I know it’s big in Montreal - some of my best nights out have been swinging.</p>
