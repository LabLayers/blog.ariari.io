It's almost the end of another year. Instead of getting nostalgic and thinking of the past, I'm taking full advantage of the time off and doing a full-reset. I'm moving in one direction - forward. How? Everything _new_.

##Setting the Scene
Today, I'm leaving for New York City, the largest city within a few thousand kilometres. I've been there only once before, for an organized event. The little time I did have to explore was spent gawking at the looming skyscrapers. You could say I'm far from comfortable in the city.

However, in the spirit of adventure, I'm going. I'm going alone. I'm going for over two weeks.

###Challenge Me
Got an idea for something new I should try? New foods, new coding tools, new books, new anything? Throw your suggestions over to [Twitter][twitter] or leave them in the comments and I'll incorporate as many as I can!

_Follow the journey in real-time on [Twitter][twitter]!_
