_Hackers, book a mentoring session [here][hackerchat]_

In the past year, I've become entirely immersed in tech. I went from learning what the heck a modulus was to getting flown to events and talking to dozens of people a day. I'm not an exceptional person by any means. I'm a product of an amazing culture of perpetual mentorship.

##Mentorship is changing.
Mentorship in the age of the hackathon is less formal. It's subconscious. It's perpetual.

Building a network of people with diverse skills and interests is now more important than trying to pair with a single guide. The hackathon community is comprised entirely of talented people who are constantly growing and learning. It's time that we take advantage of that and embrace mentorship as a part of our community culture.

##Mentorship Culture
Let's make constant mentorship the default. 

1. Always be learning.
2. Ask for help often.
3. Share the things you've learned.
